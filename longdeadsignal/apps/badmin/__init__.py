"""
The Bespoke Admin or badmin is an administration interface which is used to be
used for the general updating of the website. Unlike the Django admin, it does
not do everything, instead dealing simply with the operation of the website.

There is of course more going on behind the scenes which a contributer to the
website need not know about. The generic Django admin interface is where
developers of this project can gain full access to all data in all apps.
